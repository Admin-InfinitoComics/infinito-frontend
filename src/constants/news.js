                description: `For the first time in nearly two decades, the city of Vardhana faced a total electrical blackout that lasted 48 hours, plunging over 3 million residents into complete darkness.
                              The outage, which began at approximately 11:47 PM on Saturday night, is believed to have been caused by a cascading failure in the regional grid infrastructure—though officials are still investigating the precise trigger.It was like the city paused,” said Leena Roy, a resident of Sector 14, where the first signs of power loss appeared. 
                              No buzz, no hum. Just the sound of people lighting candles and shouting down stairwells.As the blackout continued through Sunday and Monday, life adapted quickly. Local vendors handed out melting ice creams to children in exchange for help pushing carts. Rooftop conversations replaced Netflix binges. 
                              Elderly neighbors, once strangers, became keepers of emergency flashlights and storytellers of blackouts from the old days.Hospitals ran on backup generators, and teams of emergency electricians worked round-the-clock to restore key services. By Monday evening, 73% of the city had electricity again, but neighborhoods like Greenview and East Hills remained dark until early Tuesday morning.`,
