            <p>
              Infinito Comics does not offer refunds for digital comic purchases, which include downloadable 
              files, online reading access, or permanently licensed content, once the order is confirmed and 
              access has been granted. This policy is in place due to the nature of digital content, which, once 
              delivered, cannot be ‚Äúreturned‚Äù in the traditional sense and remains in the customer‚Äôs possession 
              indefinitely.
